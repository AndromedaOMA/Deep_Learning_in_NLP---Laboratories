the following outline is provided as a topical overview of science the discipline of science is defined as both the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge through observation experimentation and reasoning and the body of knowledge thus acquired the word science derives from the latin word scientia meaning knowledge a practitioner of science is called a scientist modern science respects objective logical reasoning and follows a set of core procedures or rules to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of all things with a scope encompassing the entire universe these procedures or rules are known as the scientific method essence of science research – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge scientific discovery – observation of new phenomena new actions or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences laboratory – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research experiments and measurement may be performed objectivity – the idea that scientists in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases a priori commitments emotional involvement etc inquiry – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge resolving doubt or solving a problem scientific method scientific method outline – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge it is based on observable empirical measurable evidence and subject to laws of reasoning both deductive and inductive empirical method – experimental method – the steps involved to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include conducting initial research and asking a question about a natural phenomenon making observations of the phenomenon andor collecting data about it forming a hypothesis – proposed explanation for a phenomenon for a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis the scientific method requires that one can test it scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories predicting a logical consequence of the hypothesis testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying falsifying or establishing the validity of a hypothesis the types of scientific experiments are controlled experiment – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested the independent variable natural experiment – empirical study in which the experimental conditions ie which units receive which treatment are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous thus natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment observational study – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator field experiment – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world or as many experimentalists like to say naturally occurring environments rather than in the laboratory see also field research gather and analyze data from experiments or observations including indicators of uncertainty draw conclusions by comparing data with predictions possible outcomes conclusive the hypothesis is falsified by the data data are consistent with the hypothesis data are consistent with alternative hypotheses inconclusive data are not relevant to the hypothesis or data and predictions are incommensurate there is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion further steps include peer review and enabling others to reproduce or falsify the observations andor conclusions deductivenomological model scientific modelling – models of scientific method hypotheticodeductive model – proposed description of scientific method according to it scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data a test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis a test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory branches of science branches of science – divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned which typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature the most traditional data structure used for organizing the subfields of science is the tree of knowledge hence the idea of different scientific branches but over time several other taxonomic systems have also been proposed for that purpose such as networks tables or circular schemes formal science formal science – branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems such as those under the branches of logic mathematics computer science statistics and some aspects of linguistics unlike other sciences the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules branches of formal science also known as the formal sciences natural science natural science outline – a major branch of science that tries to explain and predict natures phenomena based on empirical evidence in natural science hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory validity accuracy and social mechanisms ensuring quality control such as peer review and repeatability of findings are among the criteria and methods used for this purpose natural science can be broken into two main branches biology and physical science each of these branches and all of their subbranches are referred to as natural sciences branches of natural science also known as the natural sciences social science social science – study of the social world constructed between humans the social sciences usually limit themselves to an anthropomorphically centric view of these interactions with minimal emphasis on the inadvertent impact of social human behavior on the external environment physical biological ecological etc social is the concept of exchangeinfluence of ideas
